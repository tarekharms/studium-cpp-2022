DEC64 is a decimal floating point format for the next generation of
application programming languages.

dec64.asm is an implementation of the elementary operators for x64 processors.

dec64.s is an implementation of the elementary operators for ARM64 processors.

dec64.obj.html is a description of the functions in dec64.asm and dec64.s.

dec64.h is a companion header file for C.

dec64_test.c is a test program.

and strings.

dec64_string.html is a description of the functions in dec64_string.c.

dec64_string_test.c is a test program.

dec64_math.c is a placeholder implementation of elementary functions. Many of these function are not accurate enough or fast enough. It should be replaced with a better implementation. The functions include

    acos    asin    atan    atan2    cos    exp      factorial
    log     raise   root    sin      sqrt   tan
and
    random  seed
